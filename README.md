# Tarot-API
## My Why

I began this repo a year ago but have only recently began to seriously work on it *(as of 04/11/22)*. I've always held an interest in the metaphysical since I was young. I've been using Tarot cards for almost 10 years now as a tool to check in with myself on my soul journey and moving towards my actual goals. 

------

**As of 04/12/22:** Gathered all images of the classic public domain 1910 version of the Rider-Waite deck as well as sample image from my custom Numerology deck. May incorporate them into this API for my own project needs, not sure.Â 

Have determined what key-value pairs would be neccessary to start with for the Tarot API. 

Sample

```json
{
    "hits": 1,
    "cards": [
        {
            "name": "Wheel of Fortune",
            "suit": "none",
            "type": "major",
            "value": "10",
            "value_int": 10,
            "meaning": "The Wheel of Fortune is the 10th major arcana in the traditional Rider-Waite Deck. It represents fate, destiny, and a reminder that life is cyclic in nature. The imagery on the card shows the fixed astrological signs from left to right: Aquarius, Scorpio, Taurus, and Leo. You also see creatures in the 4 corners that are representing the 4 elements of the minor arcana (air, water, earth, fire). Wheel of Fortune can signify major changes happening in one's life as well as opportunities. But what goes up must come down and depending on the querent's energy and where they are in life it can signify mishaps and unexpected circumstances."
